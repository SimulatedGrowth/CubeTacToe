Cube Tac Toe is a 3D twist on the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Instead of a flat 3x3 grid, players battle on the six faces of a Rubikâ€™s Cube. 
The goal is to form lines of three symbols on any face. The game includes dynamic cube rotation and a point system. 
Players compete either against an AI or another player in a 1v1 match.
